Title: Parasite escape mechanisms drive morphological diversification in avian lice

Summary:
- nanoCT scan data were used to evaluate the variability between 89 feather louse specimens from four ecomorph groups (body, generalist, head, and wing)
- specific morphological characters were quantified (head shape, proportional volume of mandibular muscularization, limb length)
- data were evaluated by statistical methods and geometric morphometric analysis, including phylogenomic data
- possible effects of louse-louse competition were explored
  
Outcomes: Feather lice have repeatedly evolved similar morphologies as a mechanism to escape host defenses and lice that co-occur with other louse genera on a host have shown greater morphological divergence.
